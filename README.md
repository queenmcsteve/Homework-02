# Portfolio Website

## Description

This is my portfolio website, created as part of requirements for the the ESMT Coding Boot Camp. It includes a brief bio, a selection of projects (including links to deployed projects and github repos), and several contact options at the bottom.

The Repo contains the index.html page, as well as an assets folder containing subfolders for css styling and images. This site uses HTML and CSS.
